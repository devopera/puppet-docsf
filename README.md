==============

[ConfigServer Firewall](http://configserver.com/cp/csf.html) (csf) and Login Failure Daemon (lfd) are designed to protect online servers by providing an adaptive firewall and access/process monitoring service.  CSF in turn uses IPtables to actually implement the firewall rules.  This module also includes Linux Malware Detect (maldet) for detecting malware.

Original Gist came from https://gist.github.com/2772865 and https://github.com/apocas/puppet-cpanel
